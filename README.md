# Autoscaling
Documentation related to the environment deployment used for my magister thesis. In this Wiki you can find all documentation realted to the deployment of a autoscaling model using Terraform, OpenStack, HTM and a monitoring system based on Prometheus and Grafana. Please see the next sections to deploy the solution in your environment. 

**Note:** It is mandatory to use OpenStack as VIM because Terraform was configured to it.

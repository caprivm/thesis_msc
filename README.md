# Autoscaling
Documentation related to the environment deployment used for my magister thesis. In [this Wiki](https://github.com/caprivm/thesis_msc/wiki) you can find all documentation realted to the deployment of a autoscaling model using Terraform, OpenStack, HTM and a monitoring system based on Prometheus and Grafana. Please **read all documentation** to deploy the solution in your environment. 

> **NOTE:** It is mandatory to use OpenStack as VIM because Terraform was configured to it.

Enjoy!
